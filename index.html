        <H1>Favourite Food</H1>
        <h2> MUSHROOM 65</h2>
        <p>
            The very best flavor comes from using fresh herbs in this recipe! Fresh thyme and oregano add an earthy,
            lightly citrus punch to this recipe. Or, use other fresh herbs you have on hand, like parsley or chives.
            It’s easy to find these fresh herbs in grocery stores, and of course if it’s summer: grow your own!

            That said, you can substitute dried herbs here as well, though you’ll sacrifice a bit of the flavor. For 1
            tablespoon fresh herbs, substitute 1 teaspoon dried herbs dried thyme.

        <h1>Favourite Heroine</h1>
        <h2>AMMA</h2>
        <P>
            The word Mother is a very pious word and whosoever is called by the name ‘Mother’ is a person who sacrifices
            and prioritizes her children over anything. Her whole Life revolves around the well-being of her child,
            their growth, their development, and their welfare. A Mother not just only gives birth to a child but she
            takes a Lifelong commitment to take care of her child.
        </P>
